## Project

Promptbox - Obsidian plugin: local-first library of AI prompts with categorization, search, and quick reuse.

Source of truth for requirements and sequencing: `docs/spec.md` (MVP), `docs/spec-community.md` (Phase 2), `docs/project.md` (tiered plan, DoD per tier), `docs/adr/` (decisions). Conductor state: `PROJECT.md`.

## Stack

TypeScript `strict: true`, esbuild, ESLint. Official Obsidian plugin API only. Desktop and mobile (`isDesktopOnly: false`).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # esbuild watch build
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
npm run lint     # eslint
```

## Architecture (ADR-0001, ADR-0002)

- One `.md` file per prompt in a user-configurable vault folder; metadata in YAML frontmatter; note body is the prompt text. Notes are the single source of truth.
- Disposable in-memory index built from Obsidian's metadata cache and vault events. Never persisted.
- UI on native Obsidian primitives, vanilla TS, direct DOM, no framework: `ItemView` (library tab), `Modal` + `Setting` (create/edit, variable filling), `FuzzySuggestModal` (quick picker), `PluginSettingTab` (settings).
- One `styles.css` using Obsidian CSS variables; themes apply automatically.
- Small helper layer (list rendering, filter-state store, debounced search); single render path per view.
- ADR-0003 (community catalog) is Proposed, Phase 2 only. No network calls anywhere in Tiers 0-7.

## Gotchas

- Never hand-parse YAML frontmatter: reads via metadata cache, writes via the official frontmatter-processing API (ADR-0001).
- Frontmatter is user-editable, therefore corruptible: UI must tolerate invalid metadata (NFR-8).
- Store-guideline compliance: clean up all resources on plugin unload; lifecycle maps 1:1 to load/unload.
- Performance target is ~1,000 prompts; list virtualization is deferred until NFR-1 measurements demand it.
- A tier does not start until the previous tier's DoD is met; every implemented requirement references its ID (FR/NFR/US, CFR/CNFR).
- `main` is branch-protected (PR required); CI (typecheck, lint, build) must be green at the end of every tier.

## Decisions from the launcher-uri chain (ADR-0008)

`obsidian://promptbox` URI action: `path`/`title` lookup, `raw=true`, no-params → quick picker.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Readiness gate:** the protocol handler registers at the top of `onload`; the lookup work awaits an `indexReady` promise resolved after the first index scan (cold-start URI safety).
- **Pure lookup:** `resolveLauncherLookup` in `src/domain/launcher.ts` returns a discriminated union (`picker`/`match`/`no-match`), vitest-covered; Notice text stays in `main.ts`.
- **`path` outranks `title`** when both are supplied; title ties break by newest `updated`, then path ascending.
- **`raw=true` also applies to the picker fallback.**
